This was a project for MESA's National Engineering Design Competition that earned us 1st place at Nationals for our Symposium presentation.

The product, Seed.link, takes in enviromental data from our prototype and inputs these live readings into our Random Forest Algorithm ML model that has been trained to make fertilizer perdictions.
The only required user input is soil type. 

The model was trained on a Kaggle database and has a 98.98% accuracy rate for fertilizer reccomendations. The website displays the live sensor readings, soil type, and once the user clicks 'perdict'
the predicted fertilizer and associated organic alternatives.
